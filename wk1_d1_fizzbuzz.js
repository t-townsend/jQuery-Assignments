//What is FizzBuzz?
//FizzBuzz Original Instructions: Print out the numbers between 1 and 100.  If the number is divisible by 3, print “Fizz” instead. If the number is divisible by 5, print “Buzz” instead. If it is divisible by both 3 and 5, print “FizzBuzz”. 

// What I want you to do:

// 1. Create a function fizzBuzz, that has no parameters, and accomplishes the instructions.

// *******************

// old way of writing functions: 
    // function fizzBuzz(){
    //     code here...
    // }
// ********************

// Please use ES6 conventions to write functions 👇👇👇

const fizzBuzz = () => { //  <------- ES6 Arrow functions

    //Your code here...
}

// 2. Create a function fizzBuzzTwo, that takes in two numbers, and does the FizzBuzz to those values. For example, 8 and 9, instead of 3 and 5. 

const fizzBuzzTwo = (/* two parameters */) => {

    //Your code here...
}


// 3. Create a function fizzBuzzSum, which has two parameters, and returns the sum of the numbers that are not “Fizz”, “Buzz” and “FizzBuzz”.

const fizzBuzzSum = (/* two parameters here */) => {

    // Your code here...

}
